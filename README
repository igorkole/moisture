Connecting Pieces

The sensor is connected to the board as follows

SIG => 31. GP26 (ADC0)
GND => 33. GND (AGND)
VCC => 29. GP22

Software

Raspberry Pi Pico SDK
https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk

moisture.c is a program that reads the sensor's data and writes the data
to the serial output.  The output is directed to UART0 and USB serial.
